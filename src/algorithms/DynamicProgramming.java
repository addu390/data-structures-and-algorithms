/**
 * There's already a section of plain recursion,
 * The simple idea of dynamic programming is to store the result of sub-problems of recursion.
 * It is an optimisation over recursive solutions.
 * Ways of implementation:
 * 1. Memoization (Top Down)
 * 2. Tabulation (Bottom Up)
 * Applications:
 * 1. Bellman Ford Algo.
 * 2. Floyd Warshall Algo
 * 3. LCS (Longest common sub-sequence)
 * 4. Search Closest Word.
 * 5. Resource Allocation.
 * and much more.
