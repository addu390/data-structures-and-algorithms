/**
 * Important topics in math useful for programming

 * Find number of digits in a number
 * 1. Iterative solution is to divide the number by 10, until zero.
 * 2. Recursive solution : Break when n is zero.
 * 3. Logarithmic solution : Floor(log 10(base) number + 1)

 * Progressions :
 * Example :  2, 4, 6, 8, 10... d = 2, a = 2, l = a + (n-1)d
 * Arithmetic progression : (Sum) Sn = n/2(a + l) and l = a + (n-1)d
 * Average for evenly spaced numbers = (First term + Last term)/2
 * Average = Sum/n

 * Geometric progression :
 * Example : 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...
 * Common ratio : 2 (a, ar, ar^2.. a x r^(n-1))
 * Sum of series : a(1-r^n) / (1-r)

 * Quadratic equations :
 * ax^2 + bx + c = 0
 * Maximum of 2 root.
 * D = b^2 - 4ac

 * Mean (Average) and median (middle number after sorting.)
 * If we have 2 middle numbers, we take the mean of those two middle numbers.

 * Prime number - Number divisible by number 1 and itself
 * 2 is the smallest and even prime number.
 * Except 2 and 3, all prime numbers can be represented in the for of 6n + 1 or 6n - 1

 * LCM (least common multiple) and HCF (Highest common factor)

 * Factorials

 * Permutations and combinations

 * Module arithmetic
 * Reminder obtained after division of two numbers
 * Operator : %
 * a % b = c (a/b -> c is the reminder)
