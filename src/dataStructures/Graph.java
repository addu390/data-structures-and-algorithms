/**
 * Think of the tree data structure as how friendship works,
 * there can be mutual friends and hence cycles in a tree data structures.
 * For such use cases where there is a possibility of circles in relations, we use graph data structure.
 * There are two types:
 * 1. Directed graphs (v1, v2) is v1 -> v2
 * 2. Undirected graphs (v1, v2) == (v2, v1)
 * Degree -> Number of edges going through it.
 * In Directed: Incoming and outgoing degree.
 *
 * Terms:
 * Walk (Path)
 * Path (No repetitions of vertices) or Simple Path
 * Cyclic: Begins and Ends with same vertex.
 * Acyclic: When a graph has no cyclic path.
 *
 * Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
 *
 * Weighted graphs: Graphs where edges are weighted (Can think of it as distance) - Example: Road networks.
