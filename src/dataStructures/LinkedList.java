     * Array-list: Store data in contiguous location.
     * Problem?: Since it is contiguous, pre-allocation of memory, however this is solved with dynamic sized arrays.
       Which is once again contiguous, incase the prior memory allocation don't have space,
       data is copied to a new location with higher size.
       The problem is, complexity becomes O(n) when the size has to be increased.
     * Problem 2: Insertion to the middle is costly, because rest of the elements should be moved (costly operation).
     * Problem 3: The same applies for deletion for an element.
     * Problem 4: Efficient implementation of queue and dequeue is not easy with arrays.
