 * When there are duplicates in an array
 * Example : [5, 9, 3, 9, 4] - 9 is repeated.
 * Let's call the 9 in index 1 as A9 and index 3 as B9.
 * When this array is sorted in ascending order - A9, B9 (ie. A9 should be before B9).
 *
 * If not, the sorting algorithm is called an UNSTABLE sorting alg.
 *
 * Bubble sort : Stable sort algorithm.
 * As we only swap when array[i] > array[i + 1].
